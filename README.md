## Overview
### Description
Is an application to manager and share your everyday tasks that can be reminders or ToDo lists with other people or for yourself.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Personal organizer app	
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as Reminders from Apple or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Manage the Reminders and ToDo's of the Users, share it with other friends and edit or read the content.
- **Market:** Any individual who needs to clarify their daily routime could choose to use this app
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending how many things has to be tracked and how busy is
- **Scope:** First is the self management of the tasks, then the creation of of shared tasks, finally in a future it can be used for especific group or targets and this can be escalated to be synchronized with task manager like Monday.com, etc.
